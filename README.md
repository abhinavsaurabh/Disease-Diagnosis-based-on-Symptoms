# Disease Diagnosis based on Symptoms
This project uses novel techniques of Machine learning and IR techniques to detect diseases based on symptoms and provide more details about the top fetched diseases including treatment recommendation.

1. TF-IDF

● We have the following files for TF-idf interaction Application.\
&nbsp  ○ combination (3).csv\
&nbsp  ○ cosine_results.py\
&nbsp  ○ generatesymptoms.py\
&nbsp  ○ Interaction_TF_IDF_Cosine.ipynb\
&nbsp ○ normal (3).csv\
&nbsp  ○ synonyms.py\
&nbsp  ○ tf_idf_result.py\
&nbsp  ○ tokenizer.py\
● Keep all the files in the same folder as Interaction_TF_IDF_Cosine.ipynb and then run the lines in this jupyter file in a sequential manner.\
● If you want to run on the colab then upload the Interaction_TF_IDF_Cosine.ipynb and upload all the above files in the same runtime cycle.\

2. ML interaction

● We have the following files for ML interaction Application.\
  ○ combinational (3).csv\
  ○ decisionT.py\
  ○ IRadaboost.py\
  ○ IRgdb.py\
  ○ IRsvm.py\
  ○ IRsvm.py\
  ○ IRxgb.py\
  ○ knneigbh.py\
  ○ LR.py\
  ○ mnb.py\
  ○ multiLP.py\
  ○ normal (3).csv\
  ○ randomrf.py\
  ○ synonyms.py\
  ○ IR_final_ML_interaction_.ipynb\
● Keep all the files in the same folder as IR_final_ML_interaction_.ipynb and then run the lines in this jupyter file in a sequential manner.\
● If you want to run on the colab then upload the IR_final_ML_interaction_.ipynb and upload all the above files in the same runtime cycle.\
